# COVID-19-Prediction
Predicts COVID-19 from PA view of X-ray

### Why X-Rays?

Since reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test kits are in limited supply, there exists a need to explore alternative means of identifying and prioritizing suspected cases of COVID-19.
It is possible that this turnaround time is even greater in rural and remote regions. CT scans, despite being used to contribute to the clinical workup of patients suspected for COVID-19, are costly. Therefore, smaller centres may have limited access to CT scanners. X-ray machines are more affordable and can be portable and therefore a viable alternative.
