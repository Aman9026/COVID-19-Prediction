# COVID-19-Prediction
Predicts COVID-19 from PA view of X-ray

### Why X-Rays?

Since reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test kits are in limited supply, there exists a need to explore alternative means of identifying and prioritizing suspected cases of COVID-19.
It is possible that this turnaround time is even greater in rural and remote regions. CT scans, despite being used to contribute to the clinical workup of patients suspected for COVID-19, are costly. Therefore, smaller centres may have limited access to CT scanners. X-ray machines are more affordable and can be portable and therefore a viable alternative.

### Disclaimer
To be clear, this model does **not** claim the diagnosis of COVID-19 and should not be relied upon.

### Data
The data used to train the model was chosen very selectively from multiple reliable and credible sources.
The primary source of data for:
* **COVID-19:** The COVID-19 image data collection ![repository](https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset) on GitHub is a growing collection of deidentified CXRs and CT scans from COVID-19 cases internationally by **Joseph Paul Cohen** and his fellow collaborators at the University of Montreal for their hard work in assembling this dataset. Along wth ![The RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-pneumonia-detection-challenge/data) dataset available on Kaggle.
